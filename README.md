# Dice Game

**Dice Game** is an exciting web-based game created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. In this game, two players take turns rolling a dice, and the score for each turn is based on the number that appears on the dice. The game switches players when one rolls a "1" and ends when a player reaches a score greater than 50 points. This game is an excellent example of JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Players take turns rolling the dice, and the score for that turn is added based on the number rolled on the dice.
- The dice roll is simulated randomly using JavaScript.
- If a player rolls a "1", the accumulated score for that turn is reset, and the turn passes to the other player.
- The game keeps track of each player’s total score and ends once a player reaches over 50 points, declaring them as the winner.
